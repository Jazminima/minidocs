# Recovery options

In most cases, to recover your wallet you will need a recent archive file that has been exported from an archive node.

## Still have access to your wallet?

If you **still have access to your wallet** (i.e. your seed phrase is correct) but it is not in sync with the latest block, you should perform a [**chain re-sync**](/docs/userguides/recovery/chainresync). This will put you on the correct chain with your latest wallet balance. 

The most common reason for a chain re-sync is if your node has been offline for too long and it cannot catch up with the chain automatically.

## Lost access to your wallet or your device?

If you have **lost access to your node completely**, you can [**restore a backup**](/docs/userguides/recovery/restoreabackup) that you have previously taken to a new or existing device. If you have a recent backup (within 1-2 weeks for Android or up to 4-6 weeks on desktop/server), then this is the ideal option.

Alternatively, you can [**import your seed phrase**](/docs/userguides/recovery/importseed) if you do not have a backup. Your wallet will be recovered from the 24 word seed phrase you provide. This should only be used as a last resort.

All the above processes can be found in the Security MiniDapp.
