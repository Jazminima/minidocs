Now a Tx-PoW has 3 possible levels, Transaction, Block and Super Block. If the Block hash difficulty is high enough it becomes a Super Block (which is also a valid block). Eventually, all blocks and data are discarded and only a chain of Super Block headers is kept as a long term store of the total PoW in the chain. Now instead of only 1 Super Block Level, let us use 256. 1 for each bit in a 32-byte hash. Each level is twice the difficulty of the level below.
