A DDoS attack, a Distributed DoS attack, is when multiple machines are used. A 50,000 strong bot-net of mobile phones, could each send a message every few seconds. A million messages is now only a few minutes of distributed work.\r\nTo prevent a distributed spam attack on layer 1 of a decentralized P2P blockchain network a small amount of PoW per message is not enough. Small amounts of PoW, to the individual users, are effectively free. Yes, they pay in power usage on their mobile phone, there is a time delay, but you do not notice it. You do not feel it.

Unlike fees, the Burn has no minimum. There is no requirement for the total Burn to be large, and able to support the mining industry, that in turn secures the chain. The burn may be high during periods of heavy traffic or spam, and as it rises, traffic will decrease, and the system will self-regulate.
