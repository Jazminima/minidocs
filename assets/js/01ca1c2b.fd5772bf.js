This is an infinitesimally small amount of data in comparison to an entire blockchain. But - each user must stay up to date with the blockchain. By doing so they can keep track of the Merkle proofs required to prove their coins not only exist but are unspent. This proof changes with every addition or update to the MMR. Should a user not keep track of his coins, they would not be lost, but he would need a third party to help recover them. He would need to find either an archive node that stores everything \u2013 for the purposes of selling the data in this exact scenario, or have previously set up a friend or chat group to keep track of extra coins (coin-proofs pose no security issues), and have them rediscover the individual MMR proofs for their coins."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Minima goes MMR real-time. Each block commits to the current MMR state for that block. Each user sends his transactions with a recent MMR proof, to prove the transaction is valid.

The MMR database stores multiple overlapping MMR states, one for each block, and it needs to be able to prune and un-prune MMR data and derive proofs quickly for multiple changing states.
