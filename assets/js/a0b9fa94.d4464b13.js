This is the layer every full member of the network needs to process. Solutions built on top of layer 1 occur away from the main chain, deliberately so, and are called layer 2 or off-chain. On layer 2, only those directly involved in the transaction need to process it, not the whole network. This is why layer 2 scales but layer 1 does not.

There is currently no mechanism that secures layer 1 with layer 2 traffic. No way to incentivise or force fees down from layer 2 operators and users to the miners on layer 1. For all miner-centric coins, this is a problem. How can trillions be transacted off-chain when only millions are spent in fee-paying transactions securing layer 1? Clearly, these layered systems are only as secure as the security of their lower levels. Less money spent equals fewer fees paid. So either layer 2 works, it scales, and everyone jumps off-chain, reducing layer 1 security by starving miners on-chain... or layer 2 does not work, users stay on layer 1, all the on-chain miners get paid, but it can\u2019t scale..."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"One solution is (very) high fees for layer 1 and thus very large transaction amounts, keeping all the smaller interactions off-chain. This does indeed secure layer 1 by paying the miners adequately, but makes it impossible for normal users to transact on-chain, since the fee alone would likely be larger than the desired transaction amount. Sometimes you have to use layer 1, it\u2019s not always a choice (if someone tries to force close your Lightning Channel and steal funds), and then what?"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Another solution is to inflate the coin supply. Just print 1% extra per year and use that to pay the miners.
